# Utils 🛠️

The `utils` module provides helper functions to inspect the parsed datasets, and to download RINEX files. About the latter, to perform TEC analysis you need both Observation (from the station) and Navigation (global ephemerides) files: `PyTECGg` simplifies this with dedicated downloaders:

* [**INGV RING Network**](https://webring.gm.ingv.it/): targeted at the Italian GNSS network, downloading high-quality 30s observation files.
* [**BKG IGS Global**](https://igs.bkg.bund.de/): Downloads aggregated multi-constellation navigation files (BRDC), essential for orbit propagation.
