# Parsing

The `parsing` module is the entry point for data ingestion in `PyTECGg`. It leverages a high-performance **Rust backend** to handle the heavy lifting of reading RINEX files, ensuring that even large multi-constellation observation files are processed with minimal latency. By delegating the parsing logic to Rust and returning native [Polars](https://pola.rs/) `DataFrame`s, `PyTECGg` avoids the common bottlenecks of Python-based RINEX readers. The module automatically handles:

* Format detection: support for standard `.rnx`, Hatanaka-compressed `.crx`, and gz-ipped `.gz` files.
* Metadata extraction: retrieval of the receiver ECEF position and RINEX version.
* Timezone normalization: epochs are automatically converted to UTC to ensure consistency across different GNSS datasets.
