*[VEq]: Vertical Equivalent: the synthetic zenithal TEC estimated directly above the station.
*[sTEC]: Slant Total Electron Content: the actual electron density along the satellite-receiver line of sight.
*[vTEC]: Vertical Total Electron Content: the slant TEC projected onto the vertical using a mapping function.
*[GFLC]: Geometry-Free Linear Combination: a signal combination that cancels frequency-independent effects like geometry.
*[IPP]: Ionospheric Pierce Point: the intersection between the signal path and the ionospheric thin-shell.
*[ECEF]: Earth-Centered, Earth-Fixed: a Cartesian coordinate system where the origin is at the Earth's center of mass.
*[zenith]: The point on the celestial sphere directly above a particular location (elevation 90°).
