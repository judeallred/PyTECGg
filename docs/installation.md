# Installation

## 📦 From PyPI (recommended)

You can install the package directly from PyPI:

```shell
pip install pytecgg
```

This will also install all required Python dependencies automatically.

## 🛠️ From source distribution

If you prefer to install from the source distribution (e.g. for development or inspection), pip will compile the Rust core locally.

```shell
pip install pytecgg --no-binary :all:
```

> ℹ️ Note: building from source requires a working Rust toolchain (rustc, cargo). You can install it via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).
