Total Electron Content (**TEC**) reconstruction with **GNSS** data – a Python 🐍 package with a Rust 🦀 core

## What is it?

PyTECGg is a fast, lightweight Python package that helps **reconstruct and calibrate** the [Total Electron Content](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_electron_content) (TEC) from **GNSS data**.

Why calibration matters? Because without it, you don’t actually know the true value of TEC — only how it changes. Uncalibrated TEC is affected by unknown biases from satellites and receivers, as well as other sources of error.

This package:
- is open source: read and access all the code!
- supports all modern GNSS constellations, codes and signals:
    - GPS, Galileo, BeiDou, GLONASS
- supports RINEX V2-3-4
- provides seamless decompression for RINEX files


## Installation

You can install the package directly from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pytecgg/):

```shell
pip install pytecgg
```

This will also install all required Python dependencies automatically.
